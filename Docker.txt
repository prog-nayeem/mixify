 - Dockerfile: Dcoker file for make image of my application in docker everything is based on image to run docker we first need to make an image for this so here for our application running we need to make the image first.
 - "docker build -f 'your-docker-image-file-name' - t 'name-of-image' .": This command for make the dockerfile into image. Here if your file name only 'Dockerfile' you don't need to put "-f 'your-docker-image-file-name'" it. \n
   " -t 'name-of-image'" which extends for your image name that you want to name.
 - "docker run --name my-container-name -d -p 3000:3000 name-of-image": This command is for run the container based on your image. This command is only gonna use if you don't want to use 'docker-compose.yml' file. Here -d for don't block the terminal run the process internally. --name for the container name. -p for port you want to map first your output port you want second is the image port.
 - docker-compose.dev - For run the the multiple image in a container in easy way. we can do without this file but we are using it only for not running long command. here we can run multiple image in the same the this file is for devlopment we can make .prod for production as well some things will change but everything will same.
 - docker-compose -f your docker-compose-file-name up: This command is for running the docker-compose.yml file. This will do the all job like running the container and building it. -f your-docker-compose-file-name we will only use if we didn't put the default name 'docker-compose.yml'.
 - Makefile - Makefile for run the command easily. We don't need to run the command in terminal we just wrote it inside makefile now i just can run 'make up' for 'docker-compose up' this is kind of shortcut but it's not necessary.
